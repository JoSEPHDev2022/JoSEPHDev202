## **Sumary** 📰

<font size='4'>Hi! I'm from Brazil and developing my skills as a Data Analyst. At the moment I use Python for everything, since it is my main language that I decided to learn (for the protagonism it has on Data Science). My focus is to use the language in the field of Data Analytics and design projects based around the data. In the future, I intend to expand my knowledge even more in Python and work in the field of Data Science, learning new languages such as R to.

<font size='4'>For my programming projects, I usually upload frequently to Github. Feel free to take a look and to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories once they're added!

<font size='4'>I have in the 'pins' section of my repositories, a list containing my main projects on this journey of learning Data Analysis.

## **About me** 😄
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently focusing on improving my habilities with Python, focusing on specializing even more in Data Analytics, mainly with Exploratory Data Analisys using statistics; 

- 🔭 I currently work as a Assistant professor in the same institution that I studied data science! Resilia Educação. There I teach and help students learn and grow using the Python language to make awesome data science projects!

- 😀 I like to play games, code, do side projects like Exploratory data analysis on multiple data sets, listen to metal music (favorite band: Bolt Thrower 🎧 🤘), and pet my cats... A LOT 🐱.

- 💬 I love talking to people and sharing stories.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a degree in History and developed an academic research project in the area, before coming to the Data Science camp!
