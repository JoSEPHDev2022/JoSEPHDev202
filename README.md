## **Sumary** 📰

<font size='4'>Hi! I'm from Brazil and developing my skills as a Data Analyst. At the moment I use Python for everything, since it is my main language that I decided to learn (for the protagonism it has on Data Science). My focus is to use the language in the field of Data Analytics and design projects based around the data. In the future, I intend to expand my knowledge even more in Python and work in the field of Data Science, learning new languages such as R to.

<font size='4'>For my programming projects, I usually upload frequently to Github. Feel free to take a look and to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories once they're added!

<font size='4'>I have in the 'pins' section of my repositories, a list containing my main projects on this journey of learning Data Analysis.

## **Current Projects** 📁

> [Metacritic_Score_Films](https://github.com/JoSEPHDev2022/Metacritic_Score_Films)
>
> This EDA project is a part of a bigger endevour based on exploring data from scores from users and critics in the Metacritic site. The scores that I am working with are Films (this project), Games (already done! You can have a look at it in here > https://github.com/JoSEPHDev2022/Metacritc_Scores_Video_Games), Music (coming later) and TV (coming later to).

## **How I do My EDA's: A Basic Rundown** 📊

**1. Understanding the Data**

In this first step, after collecting and importing the data, I work on getting a general ideia of the Dataset, and to accomplish that, I use the following Pandas methods:

```python
data.describe()    # Statistical description of the variables.
data.info()        # General info about the variabels, such as dtypes and memory usage.
data.isna()        # Count the total of null data points.
data.shape()       # The dimensions of the Dataset (how many rows and collumns).
```

**2. Data Prep and Transformation**

This step is very important, in that it is where I manipulate the Dataset, changing Data Types, variable names and also engineering new features to the Dataset, as in, I create new variables based on existing ones to further increase my analysis capabilities. In other words, I:

- Drop useless or undesirable variables;

- Rename the variables if necessary;

- Handle missing values;

- Change data types;

- Handle duplicates;

- Add new features to the Dataset (feature engineering).

**3. Univariate Analysis**

Here I begin my outlier assessment, and for that I mainly use the following features:

```python
data.hist()            # Histogram to visualize the data distribution.
data.value_counts()    # Determine witch data points are most occuring in the variable.
data.skew()            # Determine the skewness of the data.
data.kurt()            # Determine the Kurtosis of the data.
``` 

For reference, this is how to determine skewness:

And, for the Kurtosis:

**4. Multivariate Analysis**

This is where I analyze the correlation between the different variables of the Dataset, for that, I use seaborn's heatmaps, pairplots and boxplots.


**5. Questions, Insights and Answers**

As the final step, I ask different relevant question after analyzing the data, seeking to find out the most relevant insights for that specific Dataset.

## **About me** 😄
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently focusing on improving my habilities with Python, focusing on specializing even more in Data Analytics, mainly with Exploratory Data Analisys using statistics; 

- 🔭 I currently work as a Assistant professor in the same institution that I studied data science! Resilia Educação. There I teach and help students learn and grow using the Python language to make awesome data science projects!

- 😀 I like to play games, code, do side projects like Exploratory data analysis on multiple data sets, listen to metal music (favorite band: Bolt Thrower 🎧 🤘), and pet my cats... A LOT 🐱.

- 💬 I love talking to people and sharing stories.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a degree in History and developed an academic research project in the area, before coming to the Data Science camp!
