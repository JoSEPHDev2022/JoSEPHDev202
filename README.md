<font size='4'>Hi! I'm from Brazil and learning how to code. At the moment I use Python for everything, since it is my first language that I decided to learn. My focus is to use the language in the field of Data Analytics and design projects based around the data. In the future, I intend to expand my knowledge even more in Python and work in the field of Data Science.

<font size='4'>For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress in them. Feel free to take a look and to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories once they're added!

<font size='4'>I have in the 'pins' section of my repositories, a list containing my main projects on this journey of learning Data Analysis.

<font size='4'>The fields in witch I like to study and practice at the moment are:

- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🧭
- PostgreSQL 🐘
- Google Colab 📔
- Jupyter Notebook 📔

#
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, focusing on Data Analytics.  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning how to generate insights from estatistical Data Analysis.
- 😀 I like to play games, code, do side projects like Exploratory data analysis on multiple data sets, listen to metal music (favorite band: Bolt Thrower 🎧), and pet my cats in my free time.
- 💬 I love talking to people and sharing stories.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a degree in History and developed an academic research project in the area, before coming to learn Programming!
