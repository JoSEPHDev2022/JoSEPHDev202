Hi! I'm from Brazil and learning how to code. At the moment I use Python for everything, since it is my first language that I decided to learn. My focus is to use the language in the field of Data Analytics and design projects based around the data, because I find really amazing how the use of programming can be so expansive and beneficial to the society as a whole. In the future, I intend to expand my knowledge even more in Python and other languages such as JavaScript.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress in them. Feel free to take a look and to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories once they're added!
