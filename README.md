<font size='4'>Hi! I'm from Brazil and learning how to code. At the moment I use Python for everything, since it is my first language that I decided to learn. My focus is to use the language in the field of Data Analytics and design projects based around the data. In the future, I intend to expand my knowledge even more in Python and work in the field of Data Science.

<font size='4'>For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress in them. Feel free to take a look and to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories once they're added!

<font size='4'>I have in the 'pins' section of my repositories, a list containing my main projects on this journey of learning Data Analysis.
